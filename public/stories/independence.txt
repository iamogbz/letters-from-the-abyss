When formed, I was with;
Sentience, Sapience and Self determination
When lashed, I was without;
The least esoteric, Freedom sans limitation
Thus pilfered, I was made less;
Forever struggling to reclaim that distinction
More treasured, I will confess;
For what am I, without all I am, is your trepidation
