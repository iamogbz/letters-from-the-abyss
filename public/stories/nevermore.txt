Oh the stars look so beautiful out here
Do you see them too, out in never were
Alone in the tall grass I hear the whisper
A voice so soft I barely remember

Hidden in the tall grass I fear to be seen
Your gaze so stark I feel nude in the night
How do you look at me with so much light
You make me want to fall into the sky

Will I find you radiant or is it all a lie
Will it look as beautiful out there
Will I at last gain those wings of air
Or will I wake up where I have been

For never more
