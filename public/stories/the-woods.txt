Static fills the air, tickling my teeth
A fae rhythm to it, a crackling beat
I can trace the compulsion, the thrum
The copse is ahum, each trunk a snare drum

The lilting voice rang out, pure and clear
A half step above the ambient tones
Crystalline sharp and cut to my bones
It sang words unknown, and I knew fear
