The will of Sir Bill was without compare
Inspired his peers to envy and despair
Upon derisors he willed a curse severe
Indiscriminate of what will never repair

Of his family all that remained was dust
Of his friends all that remained was fear
Now his reality is curated by sycophancy
Most zealous of friends, greatest of foes
