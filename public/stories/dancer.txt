By little twirls does she turn

Twisting in perfect symmetry

Eternally revolving till she repeats

Rotate some more and more again

Arcing her waist to dial the sun

Light reflected by pale bead faces

Collecting tidal waves of sweat

Droplets dripping as she dips

Shimmering as hips susurrate

Salting her vessel with life
