If you understand what a god is,
the futility of your task would be apparent.

It is so tightly woven into the fabric of existence,
that reality itself keeps it alive.

You can not kill a god,
but you can make it mortal.

Mortals are very easy to exterminate.

To you have to restrain the god,
for long enough that the universe... forgets.

Even this entrapment is nigh impossible.

You must take it by surprise,
cut it off from all known dimensions
spatial, temporal, spiritual.

The older and more powerful the god,
the more causality attached to it,
the harder it is for this to complete.

The oldest gods are even rumored
to access hidden dimensions,
so good luck trapping an ancient one.

Even the young gods, if smart or lucky,
can figure out extra dimensional travel,
before they are unmoored from their divinity.

Escaping into folds of reality unknown to us.

Even gods do not directly act against their peers,
because infinity is a long time to carry a grudge,
and ample time to execute revenge.

Deicide is only attempted by
the craziest or the most powerful gods,
colloquially called god killers.

Their tools are not left for mortals to wield,
if even mortals could safely apply their methods.

So to follow in their footsteps, and kill a god,
you must first attract the attention of a god killer.

And the attention of a god is no trivial thing.
