If you understood what a god is, the futility of your task would be apparent.
It is so tightly woven to into the fabric of existence that reality itself keeps it alive.
You can not kill a god but you can make it mortal, and mortals are very easy to exterminate.
But to do that you have to trap the god, for long enough that the fundamental universe... forgets.
To even perform the entrapment is nigh impossible.
You must take it by surprise and cut it off from all dimensions it has access to, spatial, temporal, etc.
The older the god, the more causality attached to it, the harder it is for this to complete.
The oldest gods are said to have access to even more dimensions so good luck trying to trap an ancient one.
Even the young gods, if smart enough, can figure out extra dimensional travel after being trapped, before they are unmoored from their divinity.
Escaping into folds of reality we cannot even know exist.
Even gods do not directly act against their peers because infinity is a long time to carry a grudge and ample time to take revenge.
Only the craziest or the most powerful gods attempt to kill others, they are sometimes called god killers.
Their tools are not left for mortals to wield, if even mortals could.
So to follow in their footsteps, and kill a god, you must first find a way to attract the attention of a god killer.
And the attention of a god is no trivial thing.
