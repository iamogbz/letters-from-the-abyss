Nothing matters
Nothing matters
Nothing matters

Phrases spoken in despair
For if the entire world is broken
where, when, what, who, how to repair

Nothing matters
Nihilists are not believed
Nothing matters
Their false relief is laid bared

Confronted by all that is seen
Captured by all that you have felt
Circling the lands you have been

Nothing matters
Nothing matters
Nothing matters

Then why do hearts ache
The real ones, not the fake
Why do breaths still hitch

Nothing matters
Except you do and you and you
Nothing… not… no!
Lie unravels and out flies a clue

It matters to one, and thus to all
So when cast down, seek your empathy
First to heal yourself, and maybe everything else
