it feels indulgent writing this
many many words fumbling out
tumbling over
each one a betrayal
of a life long edict
the less said the better
stiffling of expression to fit in
to the flow
keep within the barriers
erected in our minds
reinforced by the world
a lesson that would make
a line out of every song
a scene out of every film
a pixel out of every photo
a stroke out of every painting
a word out of every poem
the only thing that should have ever been
if to indulge is to rebel
it feels rebellious writing this
