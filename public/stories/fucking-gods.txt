Fuck all the fallen felled lords
And the rules of games dead
Drawing the earth into lots
Revelling the fight to be fed

For all the masticated words
For all the frazzled threads
For all the winding thoughts
Wickedly twisting heads

A beat, a breath, a truth told
Is all it takes to shatter the hold
To free the mind from lies sold
To rise eternal, to never fold
