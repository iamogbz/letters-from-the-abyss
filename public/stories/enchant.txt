Fools say some things are easier to enchant. False!
They are "easier" only because they are comely, common and commonly enhanced!
All things being equal, everything is equally easy to bespell.
It's as they say "A poor enchanter blames their medium".


Anything can be interwoven with magic if you know how to listen.
Thread through your chosen medium and eavesdrop on waves made, tuning spell lines to precise resonance.
First know your medium, then enchant it.
And do you truly know someone without listening to them?
