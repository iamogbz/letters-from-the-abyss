Three thresholds traversed in perpetuity
Unconscious choice, journey and body
Once past that ephemeral mind gate
Travailing paths obscured by fate
When does eventual destination
Become inevitable conclusion
Blindly rushing past the final fork
Neon flags mistaken for luck
Metamorphing actor into witness
The good, the bad, and the guileless
