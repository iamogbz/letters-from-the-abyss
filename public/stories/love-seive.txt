Do you feel like a love sieve
Pours over your soul and leaves
Behind little residue
A mixed bag of we and you
Not enough to last
Changing us with each pass
Hopeful for better
Not wearing thin but stronger

But still we grieve
For we want to believe
We can hold it all
And let none of it fall
Is that selfish
Or should we feel relief
That all that love born
Is always destined to return

If so make us copper
That all water flows cleaner
Black and green
Wiry, shiny and golden
