She looked me in the eye, and stabbed me deep,
right in the breast, left of my sternum,
Left it swinging in my chest.

Didn't come out easy, multiple surgeries required.
Doc says a clean break would have helped.
Guess I should have told my attacker.

She broke it, piecemeal, then in a frenzied last feast.
Took just the hilt, fine artwork, on the way out.
Left me there, shattered with shards.

Each sliver, a cutting memory of what was never.
A broken heart choking on broken promises.
Making me a hoarder of broken things.

Doc got the sharp bits out and fixed my thumper.
Framed the fragments, guess I am a hoarder.
But I've also learnt to let go.

Ex was like the hilt, she staged her exit with.
Fine artwork, stay far away from the edges.
Shirk the pain, hold fast the love.

They say the beautiful ones cut you coming,
And kill you leaving, but I disagree! Cause Doc;
You cut me, but saved me staying.

So jilted by the hilt, I thank the broken blade.
For pain again will never hurt me! Cause Doc;
I know you're never ever leaving.
